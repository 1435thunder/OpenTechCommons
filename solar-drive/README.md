# ☀️ Solar Direct-Drive Systems

This is the heart of OpenTechCommons — a practical roadmap to running vehicles directly from solar input, buffered with supercapacitors or hybrid systems.

## Goals
- 100% solar EV drive using recycled motors
- Smart VFD integration with ESP32/Pi control
- Modular trailer design with fold-out high-voltage panels

🌍 Aiming for minimal cost, maximum efficiency, and reuse of industrial components.
