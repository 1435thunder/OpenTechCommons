# 🌍 Project: Reverse Oasis
**Rehydrating Deserts with Saltwater Stratification + Permaculture**

This open-source project proposes a hydrological engineering method for transforming deserts into fertile landscapes using a simple but overlooked principle: **freshwater floats on saltwater**.

### ⚙️ Concept:
By injecting saltwater deep into sandy soils, we can trap future freshwater (from rain or irrigation) closer to the surface, enabling tree roots to thrive and food forests to form — even in the harshest regions.

- Salt-tolerant pioneer trees like *Casuarina cunninghamiana*
- Permaculture methods (mulching, microbial inoculation)
- Decentralized open-source ecological design
