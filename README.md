# OpenTechCommons

**OpenTechCommons** is a collaborative knowledge bank and development lab for decentralized, solar-electric, and hybrid vehicle conversions — using open-source hardware, recycled industrial motors, solar integration, and microcontroller systems like ESP32, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino.

Our goal is to **empower people, makers, and small communities** with viable tools and knowledge to transition away from high-cost, unsustainable transport — one motor at a time.

## 🌍 Mission

We believe:

- **Recycling is the new manufacturing**
- **Decentralized systems build resilient communities**
- **Industrial waste is industrial opportunity**
- **Access to knowledge should be free**

---

## 📦 Project Structure

- [`docs/`](docs): Whitepapers, conceptual designs, and long-form technical writing  
- [`solar-drive/`](solar-drive): Solar-powered vehicle system concepts, wiring diagrams, VFD control logic  
- [`circuits/`](circuits): EV component interfacing, soft-start VFD logic, safety and sensor integration  
- [`code/`](code): Scripts and microcontroller code for motor control, relay switching, and GUI presets  
- [`hardware/`](hardware): Motor retrofit guides, battery system builds, enclosure specs, materials sourcing

## 💡 Highlights

- EV conversions using **recycled industrial 3-phase motors**
- VFD motor control with **soft-start logic and user presets**
- **Hybrid switchovers** between petrol, battery, and solar
- Direct solar drive without battery using pump inverter logic
- ESP32 touchscreen interface for driving modes (Sport, Eco, Cruise, etc.)
