**Empowering Individuals Through Open-Source Engineering, Repurposed Tech, and Practical Autonomy**

Welcome to the OpenTechCommons — a living library of applied innovation, enabling people to take back control of transport, energy, and infrastructure using open-source tools, recycled materials, and grassroots know-how.

## 🌱 Mission

We believe the future should be built by individuals, not monopolies. Our mission is to document, prototype, and share real-world, replicable systems that help ordinary people:

- Convert vehicles from fossil to solar/electric power
- Reuse industrial motors and gearboxes for functional, eco-resilient transport
- Develop decentralized energy and navigation systems
- Build the foundations of a distributed DIY infrastructure movement

## 💬 Community Ethos

This isn't just about invention — it’s about **independence**.  
We believe in a future where:
- Ownership means repairability  
- Waste becomes a resource  
- Information is a tool, not a gatekeeper  
- Energy is abundant when design is efficient  

Let’s build systems that serve people — not just markets.
