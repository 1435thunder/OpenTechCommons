## Abstract

This white paper proposes an open, low-cost, decentralized safety system for drone operators, which leverages passive ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast) reception via ESP32 microcontrollers. This system would allow civilian drones to autonomously detect nearby aircraft and execute pre-programmed safety responses, significantly reducing the risk of airspace conflicts without reliance on centralized control or enforced compliance.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Recent developments in drone autonomy, swarm coordination, and decentralized navigation have enabled powerful new civilian and ecological applications. However, the growing number of drones operating in shared airspace has triggered regulatory backlash due to safety concerns, particularly around manned aircraft.

ADS-B is a publicly broadcast aviation signal already used by commercial aircraft, broadcasting their location, altitude, speed, and ID. Drones equipped to passively listen to these signals can effectively self-regulate airspace behavior without requiring direct communication with aircraft.

### 1.2 Related Work

This paper builds on concepts from the [Decentralized Drone Navigation using ESP32](https://github.com/1435thunder/OpenTechCommons/blob/main/docs/white-papers/Decentralized_Drone_Navigation_ESP32.md) white paper, extending its ethical and technological principles to the safety domain.

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Goals

* Create an open-source standard for passive airspace awareness using ESP32 and ADS-B.
* Ensure autonomous drones can detect manned aircraft and perform evasive maneuvers or land.
* Encourage adoption via hobbyist-driven norms, not top-down mandates.
* Minimize parts count and power consumption for off-grid, solar-optimized drone platforms.

### 2.2 Core Components

* **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Autonomous logic, telemetry link, watchdog routines.
* **ADS-B Receiver Module** (e.g., 1090 MHz SDR dongle or UAT module): Receives air traffic data.
* **Flight Controller Link**: GPIO, UART, or I2C interface to main autopilot.
* **Telemetry Uplink**: Optional LoRa/ELRS channel to notify ground station.
* **Fail-safe Protocols**: Behavior scripts such as “pause & hover,” “return to base,” or “land.”

## 3. Functional Description

### 3.1 Detection Logic

* Parse aircraft altitude, heading, and ICAO ID
* Calculate relative distance and bearing
* Apply altitude buffer zone (e.g., ±500 ft vertical, 5 km horizontal)

### 3.2 Response Modes

* **Advisory Only**: Log and report potential conflict
* **Passive Avoidance**: Reduce altitude, change heading
* **Failsafe**: Land or hold hover

### 3.3 Optional Features

* Time of closest approach prediction
* Danger-level prioritization (helicopter vs airliner)
* Swarm broadcast for mutual drone awareness

## 4. Ethics & Governance

### 4.1 Community-Led Safety

* Empower hobbyists to build ethical systems
* Encourage manufacturers to pre-integrate the decoder circuit
* Reduce dependence on restrictive airspace laws

### 4.2 Regulatory Pressure via Standards

* Like cyclists using lights—this becomes expected, not mandated
* Undercuts rationale for blanket bans on drones

## 5. Prototype & Future Work

### 5.1 Minimal Viable Prototype (MVP)

* ESP32 + USB SDR receiver + basic parsing
* GPIO output when ADS-B plane within danger zone

### 5.2 Future Expansion

* Integration with PX4 / ArduPilot failsafe triggers
* Onboard logging for black-box review
* GPS time sync for accurate TCA predictions

## Conclusion

This proposal aims to change the conversation around drone safety from enforcement to empowerment. By proving that drones can self-regulate airspace conflicts using passive ADS-B awareness, we demonstrate the technical maturity of civilian drone developers—and offer regulators a new path forward that preserves innovation.

**We don't need permission to be responsible. We just need the tools.**
