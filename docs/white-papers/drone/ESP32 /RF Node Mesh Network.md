# ESP32 / RF Node Mesh Network for Agricultural and Remote Sensing Applications

## 1. Overview

This white paper outlines the design, purpose, and implementation of an ESP32 and RF-based mesh network for use in long-distance communication, monitoring, and control across agricultural, environmental, and remote infrastructures. It introduces a scalable modular system that enables decentralized sensing and autonomous node behavior while maintaining central coordination via a base station.

## 2. Purpose and Objectives

The main objectives of the ESP32/RF node mesh system are:

* Real-time or near-real-time sensing of environmental and agricultural parameters.
* Long-distance, low-power mesh-based communication.
* Modular and scalable design for various sensor configurations.
* Cost-effective deployment with open-source components.

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Core Components

* **ESP32 Microcontroller**: The main control unit, responsible for local data acquisition, communication, and minimal edge processing.
* **LoRa/ExpressLRS RF Modules** (e.g., SX1276 or Gemini X): Used for long-range data communication and mesh routing.
* **Optional Long-Range RF Integration**:

  * **Repurposed 433MHz Kids’ Two-Way Radios**: Up to 30km range, modifiable for UART integration.
  * **915MHz MAVLink-Compatible UAV Telemetry Radios**: Full-duplex serial communication using adaptive TDM, SIK firmware, USB/UART compatibility.
  * **DRA818V VHF HAM Module**: Configurable 134–174MHz band, +30dBm output, -122dBm sensitivity, UART interface for voice or serial data relay.
* **Sensors (modular)**: Including TDS, RTD, soil moisture, temperature, humidity, solar irradiance, and motion detectors.
* **Power Module**: Typically a solar-rechargeable battery system, optionally with a supercapacitor buffer.
* **Enclosure**: Weather-resistant casing with considerations for modular mounting (e.g., PVC pipe-based frame).

### 3.2 Communication Protocol

* **Mesh Networking**: Implemented using LoRa or ELRS on custom protocols, supporting multi-hop routing and autonomous node behavior.
* **Gateway/Base Station**: Centralized ESP32 or Raspberry Pi-based unit with RF receiver and data aggregation/storage via Wi-Fi or Ethernet.
* **Optional Redundancy**: Secondary RF channel or cellular fallback (e.g., SIM800L) for out-of-range event data.

## 4. Node Functional Design

### 4.1 Base Capabilities

* Periodic sensor polling.
* Wake-on-event (e.g., motion detected by RTD or PIR sensor).
* Transmit payload (timestamped, compressed if needed).
* Await instruction (e.g., trigger actuator, rotate camera arm, self-clean lens).

### 4.2 Specialized Extensions

* **Water Trough Clarity Camera Arm**: Servo-rotated underwater camera with AI image processing.
* **Bird/Wildlife Monitor**: Motion-triggered camera or alarm system.
* **PID Auto-Tuner Node**: For environmental control systems.

## 5. Assembly and Wiring Diagram

**Basic Node Components:**

* ESP32 DevKit
* LoRa Module (SPI)
* DHT22 (Temp/Humidity) or TDS/RTD probes (analog)
* Solar Li-ion charging module (TP4056) + 18650 battery
* Optional: SG90 Servo, waterproof camera, light sensor

## 6. Agricultural Network Example

**Deployment Scenario:**

* 20-hectare mixed-use farmland.
* 5 sensor nodes: 2 soil stations (moisture, TDS), 1 livestock trough camera unit, 1 perimeter wildlife alert unit, 1 weather pole (light/temp/humidity).
* 1 base station with omnidirectional antenna.

**Node Roles:**

* Relay data every 5–15 mins or on trigger.
* Livestock presence triggers camera scan and water quality analysis.
* Wildlife detection triggers alarm and sends event packet.
* Base station aggregates and logs data locally (e.g., SD card or Pi database) and uploads via Wi-Fi.

## 7. Base Station Design

### Core Components

* ESP32 (or Raspberry Pi for larger setups)
* LoRa Receiver
* Long-range telemetry radio (optional 433/915 MHz)
* Wi-Fi / Ethernet module
* Local data storage (microSD or USB SSD)
* Optional: OLED display, MQTT broker for integration

**Function:** Acts as network root, time sync master, and MQTT or REST relay to external systems.

## 8. Benefits and Future Scalability

* **Affordable**: Uses <\$20 components for most nodes.
* **Expandable**: Easily add sensors or functions.
* **Versatile**: Applications from aquaculture to solar farms.
* **Open Source**: Community-friendly and adaptable.

### Future Extensions

* Integration with UAVs or fixed-wing drones.
* Visual dashboard (Grafana or Node-RED).
* AI edge processing for visual/auditory anomaly detection.
* Legal-band long-range mesh adaptation (custom firmware for DRA818V or MAVLink radios).

## 9. Conclusion

This ESP32/RF node mesh concept represents a powerful approach to enabling low-cost, long-range, and flexible IoT deployments in agricultural and remote monitoring domains. With modular design and scalable implementation, it serves as a foundation for innovation, sustainability, and resilience in decentralized data infrastructure.
