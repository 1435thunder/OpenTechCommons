# Wing Motherboard PCB: Conceptual Design Document

## Purpose

This document outlines a conceptual design for a multi-layer, drone-integrated motherboard PCB shaped to fit within a UAV wing. The board consolidates all essential flight, communication, sensor, and power management systems into a compact, lightweight form factor optimized for remote sensing, telemetry, and mesh networking applications.
