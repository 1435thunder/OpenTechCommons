## üíß Water Generation & Storage System

| Feature             | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Water Generator** | High-efficiency solar-powered Atmospheric Water Generator (AWG)             |
| **Production**      | Cold coil or desiccant condensation system                                  |
| **Flow Design**     | Gravity-fed: AWG fills 5000L tank from bottom; overflow exits from top      |
| **Overflow**        | Directs clean water to external hydration points                            |
| **Filtration**      | Biochar overflow filter only (to preserve main tank purity)                 |
| **Tank Features**   | UV-resistant, sealed, with no internal stagnation points                    |
| **Spill Management**| Overflow diverted to isolated soak-away area to prevent puddling            |

## üêæ Species-Specific Hydration Zones

| Zone Element        | Functionality & Description                                                  |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Radial Layout**   | 5‚Äì8 watering stations surrounding SkyWell in even radial layout              |
| **Elevation Zones** | Restricted trough heights (e.g., 1ft for 2ft species)                        |
| **Covered Drinkers**| Nipple/valve style enclosed drinkers to reduce spillage and exposure         |
| **Access Design**   | Size-restricted entries (fencing tunnels, small gates, etc.)                |
| **ESP32-CAM**       | Monitors drinkers with OpenCV species detection                             |
| **Species Separation**| Prevents cross-species contact to reduce pathogen spread                 |

## üß´ Biosecurity Protocols

| Protocol            | Purpose                                                                      |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **No Shared Troughs**| Prevent species contact through unique hydration points                      |
| **Fresh Water Only**| Gravity-fed overflow; no standing water or re-circulation                     |
| **UV Materials**    | Prevents algae and bacteria proliferation in exposed plastics                |
| **Timed Flush**     | Automated flushing system to clean drinkers                                  |
| **Edge AI Monitor** | Behavior monitoring & anomaly detection (e.g., illness indicators)            |
