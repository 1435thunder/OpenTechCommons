# Supercapacitor Voltage Ladder Tap System (SVLTS)

## Abstract

The Supercapacitor Voltage Ladder Tap System (SVLTS) is a modular, passive DC power regulation architecture that enables multi-voltage outputs from a single input using supercapacitors and diodes. This concept can buffer, store, and distribute variable solar or intermittent energy inputs into stabilized DC taps for use in electric vehicle (EV) systems, embedded controllers, and decentralized energy platforms. This method may significantly reduce the need for matched solar panels or complex voltage conversion systems, opening the door to a broader reuse of mixed-source solar arrays.

## 1. Introduction

Modern DC power systems often rely on active switching regulators or high-efficiency DC-DC converters to transform and stabilize voltage. These systems, while effective, are complex and costly, especially when used in small-scale or off-grid applications. By utilizing passive components—namely diodes and supercapacitors—the SVLTS architecture enables voltage regulation and buffering with minimal complexity.

The system is inspired by:

* The concept of voltage ladders
* Supercapacitor-based energy buffering
* Diode bridges used in rectification

It enables:

* Multiple fixed DC outputs from a single voltage source
* Voltage step-up or step-down via tap points
* Hybrid storage between battery and capacitor banks
* Reuse of mismatched or repurposed solar panel arrays

## 2. System Description

### 2.1 Core Components

* **Supercapacitors (e.g., 2.7V 500F or 16V 100F)**
* **Schottky or ideal diodes (e.g., 1N5819 or LTC4359 ICs)**
* **Voltage tap points for regulated output**
* **Optional: Resistors for balancing across capacitor series stacks**

### 2.3 Expansion Design

Each "rung" in the ladder acts like a mini energy buffer and voltage step. Higher voltage outputs can be achieved by stacking additional stages, while regulated lower voltages can be derived from earlier taps.

Capacitor sizing and diode selection determine:

* Output ripple
* Load current capability
* Voltage drop across stages

## 3. Advantages

### 3.1 Hardware Simplicity

* No active regulation required
* Minimal moving parts
* Low failure points

### 3.2 Energy Buffering

* Ideal for short bursts and intermittent supply
* Supercapacitors handle rapid charge/discharge without wear

### 3.3 Modular Voltage Taps

* Extract only the voltage needed at each node
* Supports ESP32 (3.3V), relays (5V, 12V), VFDs (48V+), and EV motors (120V-300V)

### 3.4 Hybrid Solar Integration

* Works well with irregular, low-sun conditions
* Can collect energy from dissimilar solar panels
* Enables DIY, repurposed, or broken-cell panel reuse

## 4. The Solar Panel Compatibility Opportunity

Typical solar installations require:

* Matched voltage/current ratings
* Identical manufacturing tolerances
* Serial or parallel constraints (MPPT efficiency drop-off)

With SVLTS:

* Each panel can be routed to its own capacitor+diode stage
* No strict batch matching needed
* Panels of different voltages can still contribute
* Allows construction of a truly modular and expandable solar bank

## 5. Use Cases

### 5.1 EV Conversion Systems

* Buffer to motor controller or VFD
* Multi-voltage subsystems powered from a single solar array

### 5.2 Off-grid and Microgrid Systems

* Charge ESP32, radios, or routers directly from a tap
* Power a fridge compressor (120V) and lighting (12V) in parallel

### 5.3 Education and Prototyping

* Visual and tactile teaching aid for energy systems
* Prototyping power distribution without expensive DC-DCs

### 5.4 Battery-less Storage Nodes

* Replace battery banks for short-duration storage
* Ideal for systems with intermittent but predictable loads

## 6. Design Considerations

* Diode efficiency (use ideal diodes for best results)
* Capacitor balancing (if in series)
* Safety precautions: voltage separation, discharge paths
* Tap isolation if powering sensitive electronics

## 7. Future Work

* Develop PCB design with modular snap-in stages
* Smart controller to monitor and switch tap loads
* Integrate MPPT and hybrid battery interface
* Open-source kits or educational modules

## 8. Conclusion

The Supercapacitor Voltage Ladder Tap System (SVLTS) proposes a flexible and scalable architecture for low-cost, passive DC voltage regulation and storage. It not only simplifies solar and EV applications, but may also redefine how we view energy storage, harvesting, and distribution—particularly with reuse in mind. This architecture has significant implications for energy sovereignty, e-waste reduction, and sustainable microgrid design.
