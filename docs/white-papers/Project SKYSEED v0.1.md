# 🌱 Project Skyseed  
**Autonomous AI Mesh Sensor Stations for Environmental Monitoring & Species Tracking**  
**Creative Commons – Open Hardware Initiative**

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Project Skyseed** is a modular, field-deployable AI sensor platform designed for autonomous species identification, environmental monitoring, and situational awareness. Units are lightweight, solar-powered, and capable of real-time data collection and mesh networking. Deployable via drone, balloon, or manual placement, Skyseeds form an intelligent distributed surveillance net.

They serve as the “eyes and ears” of ecological operations like **Operation: GRIDLOCK**, designed to manage invasive species across wide, off-grid terrains.

## 🧠 Functional Architecture

Each Skyseed operates independently or cooperatively via mesh:

- **AI-Driven Perception**: ESP32-CAM performs species recognition via trained models.
- **mmWave + Optical Fusion**: Radar triggers wake-up and tracks movement vectors.
- **Telemetry Logging**: GPS, time, temperature, and species data stored locally and/or transmitted.
- **Solar Power Management**: Units charge during day and activate sensors in low-power cycles.
- **Gimbal Control**: Tracks targets across field of view for better ID & range data.
- **Mesh Network Integration**: LoRa used for long-range sync & report to ground station.

## 🛠️ Build Instructions

### 1. Enclosure Assembly
- 3D print base frame, sensor lid, and gimbal support
- Mount servo gimbal, attach camera + rangefinder
- Enclose sensitive components in PET-G or acrylic shell

### 2. Electronics Integration
- ESP32 core module + radar + lidar → power rail
- GPS, BME680 → I2C; LoRa → SPI or UART
- Battery + MPPT solar controller → onboard 5V

### 3. Software Flashing
- Upload AI firmware with wake/sleep logic
- Optional: OTA updater, camera stream & local object logging
- Mesh protocol setup with encryption key sharing

### 4. Power Strategy
- Sleep cycle based on radar presence/trigger
- Adaptive camera activation based on light + motion
- Fan activation >40°C enclosure temp

## 🔬 Environmental Use Cases

- Pest monitoring and invasive species ID (rabbits, cats, camels)
- Temperature, gas, and humidity tracking over time
- Wildlife behavior study in hard-to-access zones
- Human intrusion detection in remote areas
- Forest health & fire risk early warning system

## 🧪 Field Testing Protocol

1. Deploy 1–3 test Skyseeds in mock habitat
2. Trigger motion using controlled subject
3. Validate:
   - Radar detects and activates camera
   - AI confirms visual ID
   - Data logs to SD and transmits via mesh
4. Observe solar charge time and power retention
5. Tune sleep/wake parameters and gimbal behavior
