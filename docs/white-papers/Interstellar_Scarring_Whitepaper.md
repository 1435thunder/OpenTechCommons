## Executive Summary

This paper proposes a grounded, mechanistic model for the origin of rotational motion in star-forming gas clouds. We argue that external perturbations — such as the passage of rogue planetary bodies or asymmetric radiation bursts — act as angular momentum seeds, initiating spin in otherwise neutral gas clouds. This approach challenges the conventional explanation that small, inherent asymmetries are sufficient to produce the large-scale rotation observed in stellar systems.

## 1. The Problem with “Initial Asymmetry”

The dominant astrophysical model attributes the angular momentum of stellar systems to minor, random density or velocity asymmetries present in primordial gas clouds. However, these explanations often fail to address:
- The scale disparity between the supposed asymmetries and the final rotational velocities.
- Inconsistent planetary rotation directions, tilts, and retrograde orbits.
- The assumption that angular momentum simply emerges during collapse.

## 2. Fluid Dynamics Analogy: Finger in the Pond

Drawing a finger through still water induces rotation. Similarly, a mass passing through a gas cloud imparts mechanical turbulence. In space:
- A rogue planet or asteroid passes at an angle through a gas cloud.
- Drag forces on different sides of its path create opposing flows.
- These localized torques evolve into full-cloud rotational behavior.

## 3. Rogue Body-Induced Vorticity

Rogue objects — brown dwarfs, icy planetoids, ancient asteroid clusters — are plentiful in the interstellar medium. Their non-uniform paths across molecular clouds can:
- Trigger multiple spin vectors across different regions.
- Seed nested vortices leading to multi-axis rotational collapse.
- Naturally produce chaotic planetary tilts and spin mismatches.

## 4. Radiation-Based Torque Effects

Photons carry momentum. Asymmetric bursts from nearby supernovae or gamma-ray sources can:
- Push particles unevenly across a cloud.
- Initiate turbulence through thermal and radiation pressure.
- Induce rotational motion even in low-mass regions of dust and gas.

## 5. Observational Correlations

### Planetary Anomalies:
- Venus's retrograde spin.
- Uranus's axial tilt.
- Various exoplanets with misaligned orbital planes.

These may not be freak events, but scars from an early interstellar traffic jam.

### Rogue Mass Prevalence:
- Early data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory has already cataloged millions of previously unseen bodies.
- These objects could account for a significant portion of unobserved “dark” gravitational influence.

## 6. Dark Matter Crossover Hypothesis

While not dismissing particle physics models of dark matter, this framework suggests:
- Some “dark matter” effects may be due to unlit, cold, massive bodies.
- These act as long-term influencers of stellar spin and system formation.
- Rogue bodies may be the visible tail of an invisible iceberg.

## 7. Simulation Path

We propose open-source simulation models:
- Fluid cloud + passing mass (in 3D space)
- Radiation burst impact on gas particle fields
- Spin propagation across turbulence zones
- Planetary system formation under induced spin conditions

## 8. Conclusion

Spin doesn’t need to be inherited from randomness — it can be inflicted by passing giants and photon storms. Interstellar scarring is the hidden hand that shapes the galaxies.
