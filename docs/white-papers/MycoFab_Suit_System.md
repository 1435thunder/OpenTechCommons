# MycoFab Suit System  
### Grown Environmental Suits from Mycelium, Carbon Mesh, and Bio-Gel Composites

---

## 🧬 Overview

The **MycoFab Suit System** is a bio-engineered, grown-in-place environmental suit designed for extreme off-world conditions. It replaces traditional rigid suits and synthetic fabrics with **multi-layered mycelium composites**, embedded carbon fiber lattices, and a **viscous gel-based thermal layer**. This suit is **grown, not manufactured**, using local organic material and fungi — allowing decentralized, recursive production on asteroids, moons, or in orbit.

## 🔧 Key Features

| Feature | Function |
|---------|----------|
| **Mycelium Leather Outer Layer** | Flexible, breathable, high tensile strength |
| **Subdermal Hydrogel/Gel Layer** | Fire resistance, insulation, and shock absorption |
| **Carbon Mesh Skeletal Network** | Structural strength + passive heating/cooling |
| **Bioactive MycoFoam Core** | Lightweight insulation + gas exchange buffer |
| **Smart Surface Microchannels** | Embedded desiccants, CO₂ scrubbers, or embedded heat spreaders |
| **Patch-Grown Fit** | Custom grown to body shape or EVA spec |

## 🌱 Material Composition & Growth

### 🔁 Suit Growth Sequence:
1. **Layer 1: Carbon Fiber Lattice**
   - Pre-shaped or locally carbonized from kelp/hemp + fungi

2. **Layer 2: Mycelium Leather**
   - Cultivated over scaffold; treated with heat/pressure for water resistance

3. **Layer 3: Hydrogel Insert**
   - Derived from algae, starch, or synthetic polymers  
   - Optional: embedded coolant, passive fire barrier

4. **Layer 4: Insulating MycoFoam**
   - Expanded mycelium grown in situ; sealed inside suit voids

5. **Final Treatment: BioResin Sealing**
   - Bioplastic or chitin-based layer for final sealing, tailored to mission need

## 🔥 Thermal & Fire Resistance

- MycoGel layer resists **>1000°C** for short periods (firefighting equivalent)
- Gel + foam traps and redistributes thermal spikes
- Outer shell is self-extinguishing and char-forming — ideal for plasma environments

---

## 🧪 Atmospheric & Pressure Regulation

- Embedded desiccant strips or patches (e.g., zeolite, lithium salts)
- Inner foam layer allows **pressurized nitrogen micro-pockets**
- Passive CO₂ scrubbers + moisture recapture loops via embedded fungi or gel

---

## 🧠 Embedded Functionality

- Embedded sensors: temp, pressure, stress, moisture
- Option for **piezo or TEG mesh** to harvest motion/thermal energy
- Self-healing via regrowth patch kits (spores + nutrients)

## 🧱 Suit Thickness Profiles (Application-Specific)

| Variant | Thickness | Use Case |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Scout Skin** | ~8mm | Light EVA, internal station wear |
| **Standard EVA** | ~15mm | Ice moon surface ops |
| **Extreme Thermal** | ~25mm | Reactor maintenance, volcanic tunnels, ring-edge EM fields |
| **Juno-Class** | ~25mm multi-core | Designed for Saturn canyon habitats, external methane reactor access |

---

## ♻️ Closed-Loop Production

- Grown in low-G using **waste organics, algae pulp, CO₂**
- No need for injection molding, synthetics, Earth-based fabrics
- Suits can be recycled, burned, or converted into carbon substrates

> “Grow it. Wear it. Burn it for power. Grow another.”

## 🪐 Ideal Deployment Zones

- Cryogenic moons (Enceladus, Europa)
- Low-pressure outposts (Ceres, Titan)
- Free-floating asteroid stations
- Underground base suits for lava tubes or canyon crawlers
