Solar Thermal Tire Recycling with Sand Battery Integration
Executive Summary

This white paper outlines a sustainable, off-grid system for recycling end-of-life tires using solar thermal energy and sand battery technology. The proposed method aims to minimize environmental impact, reduce energy consumption, and recover valuable materials such as rubber, steel, and oil derivatives.
Introduction

The accumulation of waste tires poses significant environmental challenges. Traditional disposal methods are energy-intensive and often environmentally detrimental. Leveraging solar thermal energy and sand batteries offers a viable, eco-friendly alternative for tire recycling, particularly in regions with abundant solar resources like South Australia.
System Overview

The system comprises the following components:

    Solar Thermal Preheating Conveyor: A slow-moving conveyor belt housed within a greenhouse structure utilizes solar energy to preheat whole or segmented tires, softening the rubber for easier processing.

    Sand Battery Thermal Storage: Beneath the conveyor, a sand battery stores excess solar heat, maintaining consistent temperatures for continuous operation, even during non-sunny periods.

    Thermal Oil Circuit: A closed-loop system circulates heated oil through the sand battery and a processing chamber, maintaining optimal temperatures for devulcanization and pyrolysis.

    Shredder and Separator: Post-heating, tires are shredded, and materials are separated using magnetic and vibrational methods to isolate steel, rubber, and fibers.

    Material Recovery Units:

        Rubber: Processed into granules or liquid form for reuse in various applications.

        Steel: Cleaned and compacted for resale.

        Oil Derivatives: Condensed and collected for use as industrial fuel or chemical feedstock.

Environmental and Economic Benefits

    Energy Efficiency: Utilizes renewable solar energy, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

    Waste Reduction: Converts hazardous waste into valuable materials.

    Economic Viability: Generates revenue streams from recovered materials.

    Scalability: Modular design allows for scalability based on community needs.

Implementation Considerations

    Site Selection: Optimal in regions with high solar irradiance.

    Regulatory Compliance: Adherence to environmental and safety regulations.

    Community Engagement: Involving local communities for workforce and operational support.

Conclusion

Integrating solar thermal energy and sand battery storage presents a sustainable solution for tire recycling. This system not only addresses environmental concerns but also offers economic opportunities through material recovery and energy efficiency.
