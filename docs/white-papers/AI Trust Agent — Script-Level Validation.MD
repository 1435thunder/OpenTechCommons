The AI Trust Agent: Closing the Installer Exploit Gap
Problem
Traditional trust (code signatures, PKI) verifies who signed the installer, not what the installer actually does. Build pipelines get popped, adware “options” sneak in, and post-install scripts quietly plant telemetry, updaters, drivers, and scheduled tasks. No mainstream stack performs intent validation of the installer’s script/logic before the user clicks “Accept.”

Core Idea
AI-OS introduces an AI Trust Agent (AITA) that intercepts installers pre-execution, decompiles / expands their scripts, simulates the full install plan in a sandbox, and issues a Dynamic Trust Certificate (DTC): a signed, human-readable, and machine-verifiable assessment of intent, privilege use, network behavior, persistence hooks, and deviation from expected norms for that software category.

Goals
Pre-consent clarity: show users what will happen before anything happens.
Contextual trust: “Is this behavior normal for a video player?” not just “Is this signed?”
Transactional installs: atomic, supervised, and fully reversible.
Policyable: orgs can codify “never allow kernel drivers from note-taking apps,” etc.

Dynamic Trust Certificate (DTC)
Identity: hashes, signers, timestamp, supply-chain attestations (SLSA/C2PA/SBOM if present).
Intent Summary (plain language): files, services, drivers, scheduled tasks, startup entries, registry/launchd/systemd changes, network endpoints contacted, telemetry channels.
Privilege Map: requested elevation, kernel hooks, device access, protected paths.
Risk Score + Rationale: outliers vs. category norms, suspicious calls, opaque downloads.
Policy Verdict: allow / deny / sandbox-only / require vendor-minimal plan.
Repro Plan Hash: reproducible “minimal install” patch if AI prunes unnecessary steps.
Engineering Deep Dive: Hooking & Supervising Installers
0) Threat Model Cliff Notes
Supply-chain compromised but signed: malicious script logic passes PKI.
Over-privileged installers: bury persistence, drivers, telemetry.
Time-of-check/time-of-use: installer fetches payloads after consent.
Evasion: anti-VM, environment checks, encrypted scripts, JIT downloaders.
We assume attackers know we’re analyzing; we design to contain + explain, not just detect.

1) Interception (“AITA Gate”)
Windows
File type handlers: hijack .msi, .msix, .exe (NSIS/Inno/Custom), .appx via AI-OS shell shims.
Windows Installer API: MsiOpenPackage, MsiEnumFeatures, MsiRecordReadString to parse MSI tables (InstallExecuteSequence, CustomAction).
MSIX/AppX: use OPC readers / IAppxPackageReader to enumerate manifest, capabilities.
Electron/Squirrel: unwrap .nupkg, parse embedded RELEASES, inspect delta packages & Update.exe behavior.
Node/Python/Rust pkg installers: intercept when called from official bootstrappers; parse embedded scripts or sidecar JSON/JS.
macOS
.pkg / .mpkg: pkgutil --expand to extract BOMs, payloads, and Scripts (preinstall/postinstall).
Notarization check: read ticket, but do not trust as security—just metadata.
EndpointSecurity + AMFI hooks during live supervise (later section).
Linux
.deb: ar x → control.tar.* / data.tar.*; parse preinst, postinst, prerm, postrm.
.rpm: rpm2cpio → extract; parse %pre, %post, %trigger*.
Script interpreters: sh/dash/bash/python/perl/lua; detect and extract inline heredocs, obfuscated blobs.
Universal
Heuristics to classify installer framework (MSI/NSIS/Inno/Squirrel/pkg/rpm/deb/custom).
Network quine: override resolver/proxy in sandbox so any URL fetch hits a controlled mirror (records request without exfiltration).
2) Static Analysis Pipeline
Unpack/Decompress all layers: nested archives, signed containers, script payloads.

De-obfuscate:

String tables, XOR/RC4 patterns, eval() chains, compressed JS/Lua chunks.
Macro expansion (where applicable), bytecode decompilation (NSIS, V8 snapshot heuristics).
AST & IR Generation:

Build per-language AST (bash/posix, PowerShell, JS, Python).
Normalize to a Unified Install IR (UIIR) with ops: FS_WRITE, REG_SET, SERVICE_CREATE, KEXT_INSTALL, SYSTEMD_ENABLE, LAUNCHD_PLIST, SCHEDULE_TASK, NET_CONNECT, DOWNLOAD, DRIVER_INSTALL, BPF_ATTACH, etc.
Capability Graph:

Nodes: resources (files, keys, services, interfaces, domains).
Edges: actions with required privilege and persistence class.
Policy Pre-Check:

Hard blocks (e.g., DRIVER_INSTALL for category “note-app”).
“Why needed?” prompts embedded into DTC if policy threshold crossed.
3) Behavioral Modeling & “Intent” Check
Category classifier (LLM + heuristics) labels app: “video player”, “IDE”, “driver pack”.
Match UIIR against Norm Profiles per category:
Expected: codecs write to Program Files, optional shell extension, auto-update (ask).
Outliers: kernel driver, credential provider, outbound constant telemetry for offline tool.
Intent consistency: compare vendor claim text (from installer strings/website) vs. observed plan. Mismatch raises risk.
4) Sandboxed Dry-Run (Pre-consent)
Run the installer unmodified but redirected:

Filesystem: overlayfs (Linux), union filter driver (Windows), APFS snapshots (macOS).
Registry (Windows): hive virtualization per process.
Services/Drivers: simulate service manager; stub driver load calls (return success, log).
Network: force DNS→sandbox proxy; record SNI, URLs, cert chains; return canned bytes so logic proceeds.
Schedulers: virtualize Task Scheduler/crontab; record entries, do not persist.
Kernel/Elevations: intercept ShellExecute(“runas”), NT* calls, seteuid, AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges to map requested elevations.
Outputs:

Full Install Plan (ordered ops + diffs).
Secret fetches (downloaded payload hashes).
Persistence points (autoruns/services/drivers).
Telemetry endpoints.
5) Dynamic Trust Certificate (DTC) & UX
Plain English (example):
“Will create 142 files in C:\Program Files\AcmeEditor\, add a background updater (auto-start), and contact updates.acme.com every 6 hours. No drivers. Requests admin to modify system fonts.”
Controls:
[Install as-is] [Install without updater] [Sandboxed only] [Block]
For enterprises:
Non-interactive policy mode: thresholds map to automatic decisions.
6) Transactional, Supervised Install (Post-consent)
When the user/org allows (possibly with pruning), AI-OS executes the plan atomically:

Snapshot: VSS (Windows), APFS snapshot (macOS), LVM/Btrfs/ZFS (Linux).
Live Mediation:
Windows: ETW + minifilter FS driver + registry callback + WFP (network) to allow/deny per op in real time.
Linux: eBPF LSM hooks (openat, setxattr, bpf_map_update), fanotify, seccomp-notify for brokered syscalls, netfilter.
macOS: EndpointSecurity framework (ES events), NetworkExtension, AMFI/SMAppService checks.
Policy enforcement:
Strip “extras” if user toggled off (updater, toolbars).
Block unexpected new endpoints discovered during live run.
Rollback: if anything diverges from the approved plan, abort + revert snapshot.
Attestation: sign the final audit with device key; bind DTC → actual result hash.
7) Adversarial Tactics & Countermeasures
Encrypted second-stage payloads: detect staged decryptors; force decryption in sandbox; record keys via API interception.
Anti-VM / environment checks: provide real machine fingerprints via broker to keep behavior honest while maintaining containment.
JIT codegen (V8/JS, .NET, JITed PowerShell): instrument loader APIs; capture IR at JIT boundaries.
Time bombs / user-action gated steps: automate UI actions in dry-run with recorded user intent tokens.
Self-delete / self-hide: FS overlay prevents real deletion; all writes land in diff layer.
8) Minimal Install Plans (“Surgical Mode”)
AITA can propose a pruned plan:

Remove updaters; keep manual update via AI-OS repo.
Replace opaque downloads with mirrored, hashed artifacts.
Block system-wide hooks unless app category justifies them.
Output: Reproducible Minimal Plan (YAML/JSON), signed; can be re-applied later non-interactively.
Schema sketch (YAML):

package: com.acme.editor
version: 5.2.1
hash: sha256:...
allow:
  - FS_WRITE: ["%ProgramFiles%/AcmeEditor/**"]
  - REG_SET: ["HKCU\\Software\\AcmeEditor\\**"]
deny:
  - SERVICE_CREATE
  - SCHEDULE_TASK
  - DRIVER_INSTALL
network:
  allow_domains: ["updates.acme.com"]
  frequency_hours: 168
post_install_tests:
  - launch: "AcmeEditor.exe --version"
  - verify_files: ["AcmeEditor.exe", "lib/core.dll"]

9) Developer/Vendor Path (Carrot + Stick)
Carrot: Vendors ship a Machine-Readable Install Manifest (MRIM) that AITA can verify → green path (faster install, better rating).
Stick: If behavior deviates from MRIM or category norms, DTC flags and org policies auto-block.
Supply-chain: accept SBOMs, SLSA provenance, and repro-build attestations; include them in DTC.
10) Privacy & Governance
All analysis runs locally by default.
If cloud assist is enabled, only hashed features and redacted tokens leave the device; never raw scripts or user data.
Users can export DTC + Audit as evidence for vendor disputes or compliance.
11) Performance Strategy
Parallel unpack + heuristics by file type.
IR generation is cached by hash; common installers become near-instant.
Dry-run uses fast overlay; typical <1–3× installer runtime.
Live supervise only when needed; trusted green-path vendors skip heavy hooks.
12) Implementation Notes by Installer Family
MSI: parse InstallUISequence, InstallExecuteSequence, CustomAction (DLL/EXE/script). Simulate StandardActions (CostFinalize, InstallValidate). Flag Deferred CAs running as LocalSystem.
NSIS: decompile script (!include resolution), inspect ExecShell, WriteRegStr, WriteUninstaller, nsExec. Watch for inetc::get and opaque downloads.
Inno Setup: parse [Run], [Tasks], [Registry], Pascal Script sections. Identify PrivilegesRequired=admin implications.
Squirrel/Electron: examine Update.exe verbs, RELEASES, delta packages, app.asar content; scan JS install hooks for post-install network calls.
macOS pkg: inspect Distribution XML, Scripts (pre/post), launchd plists, AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges use.
.deb/.rpm: parse maintainer scripts; detect curl|wget|bash chains; ensure systemd units aren’t auto-enabled without reason.
13) Policy Examples (Enterprise)
“IDE & Editors: deny DRIVER_INSTALL, deny SERVICE_CREATE, allow SCHEDULE_TASK if frequency ≥ 24h and user consents.”
“Finance dept: installers must be MRIM-signed; telemetry blocked unless whitelisted domain & 30-day frequency.”
“Zero-trust endpoints: only Minimal Plans allowed; no network during install.”
14) Developer API (for Vendors)
Vendors can pre-negotiate an AITA-friendly plan:

{
  "package": "com.acme.editor",
  "version": "5.2.1",
  "capabilities": ["fs_write", "shell_extension"],
  "persistence": [],
  "network": [{"domain": "updates.acme.com", "purpose": "update-check", "interval_hours": 168}],
  "sbom_ref": "sha256:...",
  "provenance": "slsa.level3",
  "signature": "cose_sign1(...)"
}

If runtime deviates → instant yellow/red flag.

15) What Makes This Hard (and Why We’ll Win)
Installers are messy, heterogeneous, sometimes intentionally opaque.
We skip the brittle signature-only model and treat installs like surgery with a flight recorder: simulate first, mediate live, rollback if weird.
The human-readable intent is the unlock. Once users see “this wants a kernel driver for a notes app,” the market self-corrects.
