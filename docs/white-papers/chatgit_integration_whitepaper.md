## ğŸ”¥ Summary

This document outlines a proposed hybrid workflow model between ChatGPT and Git, enabling fully traceable, version-controlled, modular creative development â€” with a focus on cinematic scene construction using Blender and AI-based assistance.

It solves the problem of non-persistent, single-threaded chat histories and instead provides a method to:

- Branch conversations like code
- Sync AI-generated content with your working Git structure
- Preserve reusable ideas, variations, and experiment paths
- Reduce wasted energy and render cycles by improving scene version clarity

## ğŸ§± Core Concepts

### 1. **Branchable Conversations**
> Allow a single ChatGPT session to spawn multiple paths (branches) just like Git.

### 2. **Chat-Driven File System Sync**
> Every chat segment or decision can generate or update real `.py`, `.json`, `.md`, or `.blend` files in your local Git repo.

### 3. **Exportable Sessions**
> Users can request session outputs in markdown, auto-tagged by topic and date. These can be committed directly to GitHub or local Git.
