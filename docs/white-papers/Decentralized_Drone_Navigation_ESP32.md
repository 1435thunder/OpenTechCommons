# üöÅ Decentralized Drone Navigation Using ESP32

## Abstract
This white paper discusses the concept and implementation of a decentralized navigation system for drones, leveraging low-cost, high-performance hardware such as the ESP32. By enabling drones to communicate with each other in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, this approach eliminates the need for central controllers or expensive GPS systems, enhancing robustness, security, and autonomy for drone fleets.

## Problem Statement

- Current drone navigation systems rely heavily on GPS and central control, making them vulnerable to signal interference and cyber-attacks.
- There is a growing need for autonomous drone systems, particularly in industrial, search-and-rescue, and hobbyist applications.
- Many small drone operators and hobbyists are constrained by high costs for GPS-based navigation and external control systems.

## Solution Overview

- **ESP32-based decentralized system**: Utilizing Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, drones can communicate directly with one another, sharing real-time positional data, environmental awareness, and mission objectives.
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Communication**: Drones form an ad-hoc network, eliminating the reliance on centralized ground stations or GPS systems.
- **Real-time updates**: The drones autonomously adjust their flight paths based on inputs from their network of peers, adapting to dynamic environments such as obstacles or interference.

## Proposed Architecture

- **Hardware**: ESP32-based microcontroller for communication and control.
- **Software**: Open-source navigation algorithms for pathfinding, object avoidance, and fleet coordination.
- **Communication Protocol**: Use of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for seamless data transfer between drones.
- **Data Exchange**: Sharing flight telemetry, GPS coordinates (when available), altitude, speed, and mission parameters.

## Benefits

- **Cost-effective**: Reduces reliance on expensive centralized infrastructure and GPS systems.
- **Robustness**: Increased resilience to signal interference or GPS jamming by enabling drones to navigate autonomously and communicate with one another.
- **Scalability**: The decentralized nature of the network allows for easy scalability to support large fleets of drones.
- **Autonomy**: Provides drones with the ability to make real-time decisions based on peer feedback, increasing operational efficiency.

## Future Steps

- Develop a framework for fleet management in decentralized drone systems.
- Further optimize communication protocols for low-latency, high-reliability operation in urban environments.
- Collaborate with industry partners to test real-world applications such as search-and-rescue, agriculture, and logistics.
