The AI Trust Agent, Closing the Installer Exploit
Gap
The AI Trust Agent: Closing the Installer Exploit
Gap
Problem
Traditional trust (code signatures, PKI) verifies who signed the installer, not what the
installer actually does. Build pipelines get popped, adware “options” sneak in, and post-install
scripts quietly plant telemetry, updaters, drivers, and scheduled tasks. No mainstream stack
performs intent validation of the installer’s script/logic before the user clicks “Accept.”
Core Idea
AI-OS introduces an AI Trust Agent (AITA) that intercepts installers pre-execution,
decompiles / expands their scripts, simulates the full install plan in a sandbox, and issues a
Dynamic Trust Certificate (DTC): a signed, human-readable, and machine-verifiable
assessment of intent, privilege use, network behavior, persistence hooks, and deviation from
expected norms for that software category.
Goals
High-Level Flow
Pre-consent clarity: show users what will happen before anything happens.
Contextual trust: “Is this behavior normal for a video player?” not just “Is this signed?”
Transactional installs: atomic, supervised, and fully reversible.
Policyable: orgs can codify “never allow kernel drivers from note-taking apps,” etc.

Log]
Identity: hashes, signers, timestamp, supply-chain attestations (SLSA/C2PA/SBOM if
present).
Intent Summary (plain language): files, services, drivers, scheduled tasks, startup entries,
registry/launchd/systemd changes, network endpoints contacted, telemetry channels.
Privilege Map: requested elevation, kernel hooks, device access, protected paths.
Risk Score + Rationale: outliers vs. category norms, suspicious calls, opaque downloads.
Policy Verdict: allow / deny / sandbox-only / require vendor-minimal plan.
Repro Plan Hash: reproducible “minimal install” patch if AI prunes unnecessary steps.
Supply-chain compromised but signed: malicious script logic passes PKI.
Over-privileged installers: bury persistence, drivers, telemetry.
Time-of-check/time-of-use: installer fetches payloads after consent.
Evasion: anti-VM, environment checks, encrypted scripts, JIT downloaders.

We assume attackers know we’re analyzing; we design to contain + explain, not just detect.
1) Interception (“AITA Gate”)
Windows
macOS
Linux
Universal
File type handlers: hijack .msi , .msix , .exe (NSIS/Inno/Custom), .appx via AI-OS
shell shims.
Windows Installer API: MsiOpenPackage , MsiEnumFeatures , MsiRecordReadString to
parse MSI tables (InstallExecuteSequence, CustomAction).
MSIX/AppX: use OPC readers / IAppxPackageReader to enumerate manifest, capabilities.
Electron/Squirrel: unwrap .nupkg , parse embedded RELEASES , inspect delta packages &
Update.exe behavior.
Node/Python/Rust pkg installers: intercept when called from official bootstrappers; parse
embedded scripts or sidecar JSON/JS.
.pkg / .mpkg: pkgutil --expand to extract BOMs, payloads, and Scripts
(preinstall/postinstall).
Notarization check: read ticket, but do not trust as security—just metadata.
EndpointSecurity + AMFI hooks during live supervise (later section).
.deb: ar x → control.tar.* / data.tar.* ; parse preinst , postinst , prerm ,
postrm .
.rpm: rpm2cpio → extract; parse %pre , %post , %trigger* .
Script interpreters: sh/dash/bash/python/perl/lua; detect and extract inline heredocs,
obfuscated blobs.
Heuristics to classify installer framework (MSI/NSIS/Inno/Squirrel/pkg/rpm/deb/custom).
Network quine: override resolver/proxy in sandbox so any URL fetch hits a controlled
mirror (records request without exfiltration).

2) Static Analysis Pipeline
3) Behavioral Modeling & “Intent” Check
4) Sandboxed Dry-Run (Pre-consent)
Run the installer unmodified but redirected:
1. Unpack/Decompress all layers: nested archives, signed containers, script payloads.
2. De-obfuscate:
String tables, XOR/RC4 patterns, eval() chains, compressed JS/Lua chunks.
Macro expansion (where applicable), bytecode decompilation (NSIS, V8 snapshot
heuristics).
3. AST & IR Generation:
Build per-language AST (bash/posix, PowerShell, JS, Python).
Normalize to a Unified Install IR (UIIR) with ops: FS_WRITE , REG_SET ,
SERVICE_CREATE , KEXT_INSTALL , SYSTEMD_ENABLE , LAUNCHD_PLIST , SCHEDULE_TASK ,
NET_CONNECT , DOWNLOAD , DRIVER_INSTALL , BPF_ATTACH , etc.
4. Capability Graph:
Nodes: resources (files, keys, services, interfaces, domains).
Edges: actions with required privilege and persistence class.
5. Policy Pre-Check:
Hard blocks (e.g., DRIVER_INSTALL for category “note-app”).
“Why needed?” prompts embedded into DTC if policy threshold crossed.
Category classifier (LLM + heuristics) labels app: “video player”, “IDE”, “driver pack”.
Match UIIR against Norm Profiles per category:
Expected: codecs write to Program Files , optional shell extension, auto-update
(ask).
Outliers: kernel driver, credential provider, outbound constant telemetry for offline tool.
Intent consistency: compare vendor claim text (from installer strings/website) vs. observed
plan. Mismatch raises risk.
Filesystem: overlayfs (Linux), union filter driver (Windows), APFS snapshots (macOS).
Registry (Windows): hive virtualization per process.

Outputs:
5) Dynamic Trust Certificate (DTC) & UX
6) Transactional, Supervised Install (Post-consent)
When the user/org allows (possibly with pruning), AI-OS executes the plan atomically:
Services/Drivers: simulate service manager; stub driver load calls (return success, log).
Network: force DNS→sandbox proxy; record SNI, URLs, cert chains; return canned bytes
so logic proceeds.
Schedulers: virtualize Task Scheduler/crontab; record entries, do not persist.
Kernel/Elevations: intercept ShellExecute(“runas”) , NT* calls, seteuid ,
AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges to map requested elevations.
Full Install Plan (ordered ops + diffs).
Secret fetches (downloaded payload hashes).
Persistence points (autoruns/services/drivers).
Telemetry endpoints.
Plain English (example):
“Will create 142 files in C:\Program Files\AcmeEditor\ , add a background updater
(auto-start), and contact updates.acme.com every 6 hours. No drivers. Requests
admin to modify system fonts.”
Controls:
[Install as-is] [Install without updater] [Sandboxed only] [Block]
For enterprises:
Non-interactive policy mode: thresholds map to automatic decisions.
Snapshot: VSS (Windows), APFS snapshot (macOS), LVM/Btrfs/ZFS (Linux).
Live Mediation:
Windows: ETW + minifilter FS driver + registry callback + WFP (network) to
allow/deny per op in real time.
Linux: eBPF LSM hooks (openat, setxattr, bpf_map_update), fanotify, seccomp-notify
for brokered syscalls, netfilter.

7) Adversarial Tactics & Countermeasures
8) Minimal Install Plans (“Surgical Mode”)
AITA can propose a pruned plan:
Schema sketch (YAML):
macOS: EndpointSecurity framework (ES events), NetworkExtension,
AMFI/SMAppService checks.
Policy enforcement:
Strip “extras” if user toggled off (updater, toolbars).
Block unexpected new endpoints discovered during live run.
Rollback: if anything diverges from the approved plan, abort + revert snapshot.
Attestation: sign the final audit with device key; bind DTC → actual result hash.
Encrypted second-stage payloads: detect staged decryptors; force decryption in
sandbox; record keys via API interception.
Anti-VM / environment checks: provide real machine fingerprints via broker to keep
behavior honest while maintaining containment.
JIT codegen (V8/JS, .NET, JITed PowerShell): instrument loader APIs; capture IR at JIT
boundaries.
Time bombs / user-action gated steps: automate UI actions in dry-run with recorded user
intent tokens.
Self-delete / self-hide: FS overlay prevents real deletion; all writes land in diff layer.
Remove updaters; keep manual update via AI-OS repo.
Replace opaque downloads with mirrored, hashed artifacts.
Block system-wide hooks unless app category justifies them.
Output: Reproducible Minimal Plan (YAML/JSON), signed; can be re-applied later non-
interactively.

10) Privacy & Governance
11) Performance Strategy
- FS_WRITE: ["%ProgramFiles%/AcmeEditor/**"]
- REG_SET: ["HKCU\\Software\\AcmeEditor\\**"]
deny:
- SERVICE_CREATE
- SCHEDULE_TASK
- DRIVER_INSTALL

frequency_hours: 168
post_install_tests:
- launch: "AcmeEditor.exe --version"
- verify_files: ["AcmeEditor.exe", "lib/core.dll"]
Carrot: Vendors ship a Machine-Readable Install Manifest (MRIM) that AITA can verify →
green path (faster install, better rating).
Stick: If behavior deviates from MRIM or category norms, DTC flags and org policies auto-
block.
Supply-chain: accept SBOMs, SLSA provenance, and repro-build attestations; include
them in DTC.
All analysis runs locally by default.
If cloud assist is enabled, only hashed features and redacted tokens leave the device;
never raw scripts or user data.
Users can export DTC + Audit as evidence for vendor disputes or compliance.
Parallel unpack + heuristics by file type.
IR generation is cached by hash; common installers become near-instant.

12) Implementation Notes by Installer Family
13) Policy Examples (Enterprise)
14) Developer API (for Vendors)
Vendors can pre-negotiate an AITA-friendly plan:
Dry-run uses fast overlay; typical <1–3× installer runtime.
Live supervise only when needed; trusted green-path vendors skip heavy hooks.
MSI: parse InstallUISequence , InstallExecuteSequence , CustomAction
(DLL/EXE/script). Simulate StandardActions (CostFinalize, InstallValidate). Flag
Deferred CAs running as LocalSystem .
NSIS: decompile script ( !include resolution), inspect ExecShell , WriteRegStr ,
WriteUninstaller , nsExec . Watch for inetc::get and opaque downloads.
Inno Setup: parse [Run] , [Tasks] , [Registry] , Pascal Script sections. Identify
PrivilegesRequired=admin implications.
Squirrel/Electron: examine Update.exe verbs, RELEASES , delta packages, app.asar
content; scan JS install hooks for post-install network calls.
macOS pkg: inspect Distribution XML, Scripts (pre/post), launchd plists,
AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges use.
.deb/.rpm: parse maintainer scripts; detect curl|wget|bash chains; ensure systemd units
aren’t auto-enabled without reason.
“IDE & Editors: deny DRIVER_INSTALL, deny SERVICE_CREATE, allow
SCHEDULE_TASK if frequency ≥ 24h and user consents.”
“Finance dept: installers must be MRIM-signed; telemetry blocked unless whitelisted
domain & 30-day frequency.”
“Zero-trust endpoints: only Minimal Plans allowed; no network during install.”

Installers are messy, heterogeneous, sometimes intentionally opaque.
We skip the brittle signature-only model and treat installs like surgery with a flight
recorder: simulate first, mediate live, rollback if weird.
The human-readable intent is the unlock. Once users see “this wants a kernel driver for a
notes app,” the market self-corrects.

AI Trust Agent — README Summary
The Problem:
Traditional trust certificates only confirm who signed the installer, not what the installer actually
does. Supply chain compromises, hidden telemetry, and privilege escalation sneak into
“trusted” packages every day.
The Solution:
The AI Trust Agent (AITA) for AI-OS scans installer scripts before they run. It simulates the full
install in a sandbox, summarizes behavior in plain language, and issues a Dynamic Trust
Certificate (DTC) that validates intent, privilege use, and hidden persistence — not just
signatures.
Key Features:
This closes the installer exploit gap that no AV or PKI solves today. Signed ≠ Safe. AI-OS
makes intent the new root of trust.
user_choice = present_summary_and_controls(dtc)
if user_choice.approved:
result = supervised_transaction_install(blob, user_choice.plan)
audit = sign_audit(result, dtc)
return audit
else:
return {"status": "blocked", "dtc": dtc}
Pre-install clarity: know exactly what the installer will change.
Contextual trust: is this normal behavior for this app type?
Transactional installs: atomic, supervised, fully reversible.
Minimal install plans: strip out hidden updaters, telemetry, or bloat.
